## üìã Features

- Generate Solana addresses with custom prefixes or suffixes
- RESTful API with asynchronous job processing
- Real-time status updates for generation jobs
- Ability to cancel running jobs
- Parallel processing for optimal performance
- Health check endpoint for monitoring

- `RUST_LOG`: Log level (default: info)

## üîß API Reference

### Generate a Vanity Address

```http
POST /generate
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "pattern": "abc",
    "position": "prefix"  // or "suffix"
}
```

Response:
```json
{
    "job_id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000"
}
```

### Check Generation Status

```http
GET /status/:job_id
```

Response (running):
```json
{
    "status": "running"
}
```

Response (complete):
```json
{
    "status": "complete",
    "result": {
        "public_key": "abc...",
        "private_key": "..."
    }
}
```

### Cancel a Running Job

```http
POST /cancel/:job_id
```

Response:
```json
{
    "status": "cancelled"
}
```

### Health Check

```http
GET /health
```

Response:
```json
{
    "status": "ok",
    "timestamp": "2023-09-01T12:34:56Z"
}
```

## üåü Examples

The `examples` directory contains sample client code showing how to interact with the API:

- `client.js` - JavaScript example
- `client.py` - Python example

To use the JavaScript example:
```bash
node examples/client.js
```

To use the Python example:
```bash
python examples/client.py
```

These examples demonstrate how to start a generation job, poll for results, and retrieve the generated key pair.

## üîí Security Notes

- Private keys are only transmitted once and never stored on the server
- All communication should be over HTTPS in production
- Consider implementing rate limiting for public-facing deployments
